This requires Selenium for Node.  To install:

npm install selenium-webdriver

You also need Firefox installed.  If you have Chrome instead, change
"Browser.FIREFOX" to "Browser.GOOGLE" in drivedown.js, but this
package has not been tested with Chrome much.

Usage

node drivedown.js URL-FILE.TXT

where URL-FILE.TXT is a file where each line contains a NAME and and
URL pair, like this:

some-name https://drive.google.com/...

The file can also just be a list of URLs -- in that case, all the
directories will be called ~/Downloads/drivedown(1), ...(2), etc.

The ~/Downloads/some-name/ directory will be filled with the pages.

Alternatively, you can say

node drivedown.js URL [NAME]

to download URL to ~/Downloads/NAME/.
